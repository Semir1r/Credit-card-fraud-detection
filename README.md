# Credit Risk Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is focused on understanding, predicting, and classifying credit risk using machine learning models. The goal is to build a system that can predict whether a user is a high or low credit risk based on their transaction data. The project encompasses various stages such as data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.

## Task 1 - Understanding Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower may default on a loan or credit obligation. This task aims to understand the core concepts of credit risk, including the evaluation of default likelihood and risk management strategies used in the financial industry.

## Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, we explore the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics. The objective is to perform an in-depth analysis that includes identifying patterns, distributions, outliers, and missing values.

### Steps:
- **Overview of the Data**: Review the datasetâ€™s rows, columns, and data types.
- **Summary Statistics**: Generate statistics for central tendency and distribution.
- **Distribution of Numerical Features**: Visualize the distribution to detect skewness or outliers.
- **Distribution of Categorical Features**: Analyze frequency and variability of categorical variables.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between numerical variables.
- **Missing Values**: Identify and address missing data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Use boxplots to detect and handle outliers.

## Task 3 - Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. This phase involves creating new features, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and normalizing or standardizing numerical features.

### Steps:
1. **Create Aggregate Features**:
   - Total Transaction Amount
   - Average Transaction Amount
   - Transaction Count
   - Standard Deviation of Transaction Amounts
2. **Extract Features**:
   - Transaction Hour
   - Transaction Day
   - Transaction Month
   - Transaction Year
3. **Encode Categorical Variables**:
   - One-Hot Encoding
   - Label Encoding
4. **Handle Missing Values**:
   - Imputation (mean, median, mode) or Removal
5. **Normalize/Standardize Numerical Features**:
   - Scaling numerical features to a consistent range.

## Task 4 - Default Estimator and WoE Binning
Here, we classify users based on their likelihood of default using RFMS formalism. We create a default estimator and apply Weight of Evidence (WoE) binning to improve the quality of the features used for modeling.

### Steps:
1. **Construct a Default Estimator**: Establish boundaries to classify users into high or low-risk categories.
2. **WoE Binning**: Apply Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) to transform features into more predictive forms.

## Task 5 - Modelling
This task involves training machine learning models to predict credit risk, followed by model evaluation to assess performance.

### Steps:
1. **Split the Data**: Partition the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Choose Models**: Train at least two models from the following:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
3. **Train the Models**: Train the models on the training data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to fine-tune the models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

## Task 6 - Model Serving API Call
After training the models, we deploy them via a REST API for real-time predictions. The goal is to create an API that can accept new data and return predictions on credit risk.

### Steps:
1. **Choose Framework**: Use a framework such as Flask, FastAPI, or Django REST for API development.
2. **Load the Model**: Load the trained machine learning model for inference.
3. **Define API Endpoints**: Implement endpoints to accept input and return predictions.
4. **Handle Requests**: Process incoming requests, make predictions using the model, and return the results.
5. **Deploy the API**: Deploy the API on a web server or cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
