# Credit Scoring Model Development

## Overview

This project involves creating a Credit Scoring Model for Bati Bank in collaboration with an eCommerce platform. The model aims to assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by analyzing past borrower data in relation to their loan performance. The insights gained will enable the implementation of a buy-now-pay-later service, allowing customers to purchase products on credit if they qualify.

### Key Concepts

- **Credit Risk**: The probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan, leading to financial losses for the lender.
- **Default Definition**: Aligned with the Basel II Capital Accord, ensuring adherence to global credit risk standards.

## Tasks and Objectives

### Task 1: Understanding Credit Risk

### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform detailed EDA on the provided dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships among the features.

#### Steps:

1. **Overview of the Data**

   - Assess the structure of the dataset.
   - Identify the number of rows, columns, and data types.

2. **Summary Statistics**

   - Compute measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range).
   - Understand the shape of the data’s distribution.

3. **Distribution of Numerical Features**

   - Visualize numerical feature distributions using histograms and KDE plots.
   - Detect patterns, skewness, and potential outliers.

4. **Distribution of Categorical Features**

   - Analyze the frequency and variability of categorical features using count plots.

5. **Correlation Analysis**

   - Use heatmaps and correlation matrices to understand relationships among numerical features.

6. **Identifying Missing Values**

   - Identify missing data.
   - Determine appropriate imputation strategies to handle missing values.

7. **Outlier Detection**

   - Use box plots to identify and visualize outliers in numerical data.

## Usage

Follow these steps to execute the project:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform all EDA tasks as outlined.
3. **Model Development**: Use insights from EDA to create a robust credit scoring model.
4. **Evaluation**: Validate the model using appropriate metrics to ensure its effectiveness.
